# Reinforcememnt Learning Library
Reinforcement Learning Experiments 
In this project, I am attempting to build a set of RL classes to pave the way to build a multi-agent simulator 

Individual classes can be forked and used in your own program. I did not create an API to use it yet.
all code in the code folder is ready to compile under _Visual Studio 2017_

## Build Status 
Not ready yet
## Current Activity
<strike>Modifying collections to lists intead of static arrays to allow dynamic environments</strike>
Building an implementation to test this agent, a traffic light intersection.
This will require:

1. Traffic simulator 
1. A single agent to control the intersection traffic lights 
1. Visualization (optional)
