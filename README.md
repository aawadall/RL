# Reinforcememnt Learning Library
Reinforcement Learning Experiments 
In this project, I am attempting to build a set of RL classes to pave the way to build a multi-agent simulator 

Individual classes can be forked and used in your own program. I did not create an API to use it yet.
all code in the code folder is ready to compile under _Visual Studio 2017_
